## Text
This is an Rmarkdown document for my submission. I used two dataset. The cars dataset [https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/cars.html](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/cars.html) and the pressure dataset [https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/pressure.html](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/pressure.html). In this document we will see an example of a bulleted list of 3 items, a plot of the pressure dataset and a table of the tops 6 rows of the cars dataset
