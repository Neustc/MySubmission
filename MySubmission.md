## Background
How Many Americans Are Married To Their Cousins?. The raw data behind the story "How Many Americans Are Married To Their Cousins? at [538.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) published an article entitled ["How Many Americans Are Married To Their Cousins"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-are-married-to-their-cousins/). An estimated 0.2 percent of marriages in the United States are between individuals who are second cousins or closer — that means there are about 250,000 people in America in those relationships. I know you asked about first cousins, but all the research I’ve found uses second cousins as the benchmark of consanguinity (more commonly known as intermarriage).
