## Background
How Many Americans Are Married To Their Cousins?. The raw data behind the story "How Many Americans Are Married To Their Cousins? at [538.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) published an article entitled ["How Many Americans Are Married To Their Cousins"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-are-married-to-their-cousins/). An estimated 0.2 percent of marriages in the United States are between individuals who are second cousins or closer — that means there are about 250,000 people in America in those relationships. 7I know you asked about first cousins, but all the research I’ve found uses second cousins as the benchmark of consanguinity (more commonly known as intermarriage). A data frame with 70 rows representing countries. 



```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::kable(head(cousin_marriage), 
                      caption = "Top of the cousin Marriage") 
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
